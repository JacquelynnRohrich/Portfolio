<p> Hi my name is Jackee Rohrich I am 34, I grew up in Riverside California and I current live in Bismarck, ND. 
    I have an amazing Boyfriend named Jeff and I also am a Mother to Ella who is 10 years old, and Cohen who is 8 years old. 
    Before joining Lambda School, I was a Cosmetologist who owned my own business did freelance makeup for commercials 
    and also worked with John Paul Mitchell Systems on many hair shows. About 3 months ago I was injured and I couldnâ€™t 
    continue doing hair so I felt like an entire career change was needed. My Boyfriend Jeff had read about Lambda School 
    through a twitter feed He followed so He talked me into enrolling since computers are kind of my jam.
    Currently I find Lambda School very challenging and I am somewhat drowning some days more than others. 
    Sometimes there is moments when I can catch my breath, but having an amazing group of fellow students to drown 
    with makes life easier. I doubt I would be even this far without them.

							<p>This was done on my friend Steven, He is obsessed with Johnny Depp and the Pirates movies. 
                                We ended up doing this 3 times in 2016 for various Halloween parties.<p>

							<p>Using myself as a canvas, I decided for Halloween 2017, 
                                I would spruce up an old costume idea using my makeup skills. 
                                I also did my friend as Sally.<p>

							<p>Every year a small town named Mandan, ND puts on a Zombie Pub Crawl and I had a pizza onesie (Union suit) and wanted to go as a girl who died by burns to her face while cooking a pizza and became a zombie.</p>

							<p>Let me make a disclaimer right away.. No Fish were hurt in the making of this costume! This is my take on Darla from the movie "Finding Nemo" I made braces out of framing wire and I had stained my teeth to look like I had braces and used an eyeliner to make many many dots to create freckles.</p>
